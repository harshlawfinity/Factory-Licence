            What You Need to Know About <br /> Factory Licence
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500 mb-6 text-xs md:text-sm text-justify">
If you are planning to set up a manufacturing plant in India, then obtaining a Factory Licence is the first step that needs to be taken. As per the requirements of the Factories Act, 1948, this licence is mandatory for any premises involved in the manufacturing activities, especially if you are using power and have employed 10 or more workers or in case you are operating without power but employing 20 or more people. The Factory Licence is issued by the Labour Department or the Chief Inspector of Factories of that particular state. It serves as the documented evidence that your premises meets all the criteria of health, safety, welfare and environmental standards mandated by the law.           
           </p>
          

          <p className="text-gray-500 mb-6 text-xs md:text-sm text-justify">
Obtaining a Factory Licence is not just a mere paperwork exercise but involves a comprehensive review of the layout of the factory, itâ€™s safety measures, waste management system and compliance with various rules and regulations. The licence may need to be renewed every year or within a stipulated time as per the requirements of the state. Ignoring these requirements shall lead to legal complications including penalties, fines etc. and in some case even lead to the force shutdowns.          </p>
